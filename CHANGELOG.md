## 0.2.0 - Terminal Runtime Foundation

Status: release preparation.

Tekstide `0.2.0` is scoped as an M4 terminal/runtime/security foundation release through RFC-009. It is not the full AI CLI workbench.

### Implemented

- RFC-007 Linux PTY feasibility evidence:
  - PTY-backed shell startup;
  - output capture/rendering in the spike harness;
  - scripted input;
  - resize observation;
  - foreground-child termination, timeout, and SIGKILL fallback observations;
  - output flood and latency evidence.
- RFC-008 TerminalSession/process lifecycle foundation:
  - project-owned Linux plain shell launch;
  - runtime boundary that keeps PTY/process handles out of persisted domain metadata;
  - bounded PTY output reads and dropped-byte accounting;
  - project-addressed input and resize routing;
  - process-group termination with SIGTERM, timeout, SIGKILL fallback, and honest unresolved cleanup outcomes;
  - ProjectSession terminal collection integration and visible-slot policy;
  - project close assessment for real running terminals.
- RFC-009 terminal security boundary:
  - conservative ANSI/VT/OSC parser/security boundary;
  - exact accepted and inert sequence-family policy;
  - inert/diagnostic OSC clipboard, title, hyperlink, host-integration, private-mode, query, reply, unsupported control, and invalid-byte behavior;
  - bounded diagnostics without raw private terminal output, OSC payloads, pasted text, shell output, or environment-like values;
  - typed-input vs paste-input classification before PTY write;
  - multiline paste confirmation decision before PTY write;
  - C0, DEL, and C1 control-containing paste blocking;
  - model-level trusted UI / terminal spoofing boundary;
  - honest Plain/Supervised/Managed labels without command-approval overclaim.

### Deferred

- Desktop GUI runtime and final terminal renderer.
- App/UI commands for launching, selecting, and closing terminals.
- App/UI paste-event wiring, rendered paste confirmation, paste queue, and replay behavior.
- Rendered trusted dialogs and screenshot-backed visual spoofing evidence.
- App-wide close aggregation.
- Cross-platform terminal runtime and GUI security evidence beyond Linux.
- AI CLI profile execution and AgentRun launch.
- Transcript capture, retention, purge, and review workflow.
- Durable audit storage.
- Command approval.
- File watcher and overwrite-confirmation UI.

- Root-bound project file access policy.
- Bounded explorer read model.
- UTF-8 text document buffer.
- Safe save and external-change detection.
- Dirty-state propagation to project/runtime summaries.
- Shell-visible Content Mode evidence.

### Deferred

- Desktop GUI runtime.
- PTY terminal runtime.
- AI CLI profile execution and AgentRun launch.
- Transcript capture and review workflow.
- Generated diff/artifact review.
- Running-process safe close.
- Paste protection for real terminal input.
- File watcher.
