# RFC-016 PR-016-B: source-locale catalog.
#
# The source locale (`en`) is compiled into the binary (see
# `i18n::catalog`), so a missing or corrupt catalog file on disk can
# never make the application unusable -- this file only needs to exist
# at build time.
#
# Actual translations are content work, not this RFC's job (RFC-016
# §Non-Goals). These keys exist to prove the lookup, locale-selection,
# and fallback machinery works, not to cover a real UI -- RFC-015 has
# not been implemented yet, so there is no real UI to cover. Real
# surfaces add real keys as they are built.
